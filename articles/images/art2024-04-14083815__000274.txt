You know, keeping some distance between folks is just part of life. Even with your closest buds or fam, it's good to have some boundaries. 'Cause, like, sometimes we accidentally feed off each other's vibes, and before you know it, they start fading away. Friends or family, same deal.
And let's talk about arguments, man. Is it really all about being logical? When do we stop and think about where the other person's coming from? Sometimes, you just wanna spill your guts, or maybe you hope they'll get what's up with the vibe.
Now, about tolerance and compromise, that's never on just one person. When folks back up their opinions, they look for proof, but when they start questioning, they get real nitpicky.
But, like, can we handle it when others judge us by the same rules? And can we really judge them the same way?
It's a real brain-buster 'cause every path's a story, and every crossroads is a big moment. Maybe some folks don't get you, and others never really know you. But what they say about you ain't always the real you; it's just what they think.
We're all just figuring out this life journey, you know? Whether it's being patient or sticking to your guns, each step helps us grow.
At the end of the day, you're you. Keep asking questions, facing them head-on. 'Cause all that thinking is what shapes where we end up in life.
Folks might've gotten me wrong yesterday, and they might do it again today or tomorrow. But I ain't sweating it; I'm still me.
That's the wisdom from the Little Cat, April 14, 2024.
