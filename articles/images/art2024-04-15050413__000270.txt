Sometimes when I'm feeling lost, I tend to seek advice from others. But you know what? I always end up hearing the same old line: "Don't overthink it!" And then, that's it. End of conversation. Seriously, isn't that phrase just too overused?
Life's full of twists and turns, and inevitably, we find ourselves confused, doubtful, heartbroken, or in pain at times. When we need help, we usually turn to friends or family for advice, only to hear that same old line: "Don't overthink it!"
It seems like that phrase pops up in various situations, almost like it's become the go-to response. But behind that simple phrase lie a lot of frustration and the inability to provide a real solution.
Can we really "not overthink it"? Humans are natural thinkers. If we stop thinking, can we even call ourselves human? Thinking is what sets us apart from other creatures. It's how we interact with the world around us. It's the dialogue within ourselves. Thinking allows us to explore, create, and understand.
Abandoning thought means abandoning a part of ourselves. Everyone's situation and feelings are different. We can't fully comprehend each other's inner worlds. How many people truly take the time to empathize and understand from another's perspective before trying to persuade or simply brushing them off with a "Oh, just don't think about it"?
Can we really put ourselves in another's shoes, or is it just wishful thinking? The old saying goes, "Don't advise others on goodness unless you've experienced their suffering." Sometimes, even those closest to us can't truly understand our pain.
When we hear "Don't overthink it," maybe it's because the other person can't find the right words to comfort us or can't grasp how we're feeling. What we need in moments of confusion, doubt, heartbreak, or pain isn't just a simple "Don't overthink it." It's genuine communication and understanding.
Sometimes, it's not about finding a solution but simply seeking emotional support and understanding. Listen, think, but don't confuse fantasy with reality. Give yourself space to think, then express yourself slowly.
With each other's care and support, maybe we can better understand ourselves and face reality. Sometimes, even if we can't offer a solution, understanding and supporting each other can be a tremendous help.
In times of darkness and despair, perhaps all we need is a glimmer of hope and support to find our way back to the light.
