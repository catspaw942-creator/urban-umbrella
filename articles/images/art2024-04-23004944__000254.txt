Longevity" typically refers to older individuals within the family or society, and respecting the elderly is considered a fundamental value. However, this is contingent upon deserving respect; how can one claim the title of "elder" when they show disdain and lack empathy or support, emphasizing their own status and authority?
Encountering such individuals, respecting the elderly and wise is built upon a foundation of character and morality, which these individuals evidently lack. When facing such people, it's not worth wasting respect on those who don't deserve it.
What constitutes an elder? Only those deserving respect can be considered elders. Displaying arrogance and condescension, lacking empathy and support—these so-called elders? A blanket would do better; at least it brings warmth
