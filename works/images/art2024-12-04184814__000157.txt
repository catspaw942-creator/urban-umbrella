In the ruins of the city, Lina was no longer the helpless student she once was. 
Now, she was a well-known mercenary. Armed with a heavy machine gun and riding a compact military motorcycle, 
her cute cat ears and tail had become her signature. She took on all kinds of missions—escorting civilians, raiding enemy bases—with precision and determination, never wasting time on hesitation.
Yet, after every mission, she would pause for a moment, standing amidst the rubble. Her eyes scanned the desolate streets, as if searching for something lost—a faint trace of hope.
廢墟城市中，莉娜已不再是那個無助的學生，如今她是有名的傭兵。手握重機槍，騎著小巧的軍用摩托車，可愛的貓耳與尾巴成了她的獨特的象徵，她執行各類任務，護送平民、突襲敵陣，行事果決，從不拖泥帶水。然而，每次任務結束，她總會駐足片刻，望著破敗的街道，似在尋回某種逝去的希望。
